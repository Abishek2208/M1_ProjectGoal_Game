# VOTING MACHINE
# INTORDUCTION
we gonna make a simple graphic-based project Electronic Voting Machine Prototype using C, which demonstrates the working of the electronic voting machine.A voting machine is a machine used to record votes without paper. The first voting machines were mechanical but it is increasingly more common to use electronic voting machines.

# OBJECTIVE
• To build a system that can receive input and generate automatically output in easy way and short time.
•	To build a monitoring system that is able to monitor
•	To store properly
•	To enter and preserve details

# SWOT
## STRENGTH:
Simple & Easy to Use.
Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable.
## WEAKNESS:
The data stored is prone to cyber hacks.
Code implemented can be done better 
## OPPORTUNITIES:
 Used during election times.
## THREATNESS:
  This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable by third party members or the outside organization members.
